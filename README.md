### Comments:
I Began taking my research in this field seriously in February 2024. For a couple months prior I had heard of this field and briefly taken courses and read papers that lead to my interest being sparked enough to where now I wish to pursue a career in this field. I hope to gain a good knowledge throughout the rest of my academic career before I graduate to be able to enter industry with a sufficient knowledge to contribute immediately.
